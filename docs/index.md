## Welcome!
Welcome to my site! I graduated Georgia Institute of Technology in December of 2020 as a Mechanical Engineering major with a minor in Computer Science. While at Tech, I was member of our club ice hockey team for 4.5 years. Outside of classes I enjoy reading, climbing, playing sport with friends, and traveling.
