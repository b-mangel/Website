## Undergraduate Research Assistant
During the Fall of 2020 I worked remotely as a research assistant in the Dynamic Adaptive Robotic Technologies (DART) Lab on the Rapid Operator Awareness with Mobile Robotics [(ROAMR)](https://sites.gatech.edu/dart-lab/research/) Project. The focus of this project is to increase human saftey through use of a lower-body exoskeleton and tactile sensors. While this project had a separate Virtically Integrated Program (VIP) team, I worked alone, directly with one of the graduate students, Aakash Bajpai. During this semester I was restricted to designing motor housings, output gearing, and carbon fiber molds in SOLIDWORKS due to the Coronavirus Pandemic.

I will not be describing the project in detail and instead focus on my contributions to it. For a greater in-depth analysis of what the project is and its main focus, please follow these links, you may need an account with IEEE for one of them:
- [Enhancing Physical Human Evasion of Moving Threats Using Tactile Cues](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8943999)
  - [Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_ta9MbeRus)

Throughout the semester I was asked to create alternatives to the motor housing that was currently designed. These alternatives were created as a backup measure in the instance that the orignal motor was too powerful and might cause injury the operator of the exoskeleton. I created two different motor housings for two different motors, the first one is the Maxon EC 90 flat Ã˜90 mm, brushless, 600 W, with Hall sensors and the second motor is an Allied Motion Frameless Brushless Direct Drive Torque Motor.

Additionally, I redesigned the output gearing for the motors on the exoskeleton and designed 3D printed molds for carbon fiber ribs for the exoskeleton.
